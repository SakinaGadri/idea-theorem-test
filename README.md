# Idea Theorem Technical Interview

### How to deploy
Pre-requiste: Make sure Node and npm is installed.
1. Clone the repository and install all the requirements: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/signup` to see the registration form.


### There are improvements that can be made to this:
1. Having global theme.
2. The Mobile UI isn't as clean as I'd like. This can be fixed with global theme.
2. Removing redundant code across places.
3. Hashing the password when sending it over the API.
4. Having a small list of requirements for the password which shows when we hover over an information icon
